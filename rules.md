### 1 League Administration 
It is our objective to continue to grow Saturday Night Pro Mazda Cup league, and we hope for every member to have the same objective. By recognizing and addressing issues from the previous season(s), being intuitive, conscious, and versatile in solutions to keep the league the best it can be, we can achieve any goal.

#### 1.1.1. Main Staff:
- Martin McDermid (Owner)
- Chris Mogridge (Race Admin)
- Ewan Logue (Race Admin)

Our core group of admins strive to make each race enjoyable and competitive for each member. While we are an open league to any skill level, competition is still present and in turn, can cause issues amongst members. The League Administration is here to help ease the issues and solve problems.

#### 1.1.2. Secondary and New Admins:
Even though we have our Main Staff, during events it can be hard for an admin to see something happen or judge it accordingly. So, a few seasoned members are looked upon as a Secondary Crew of admins. We don't disclose who these members are, as they're purely for eyes and ears on the track to help relay information to the Main Staff, as well as occasional opinions on any league changes or issues.

A new admin can be added at any time. The Main Staff will call upon someone if we deem it necessary to add another admin to help cover all the weekly and in-race duties. Typically, this would be a seasoned and trusted member of the league. But, anyone is welcome to apply to be an admin (Main or Secondary) by messaging one of the Main Staff. A meeting with the entire Main Staff will be held and a decision come with the applying member present.

#### 1.1.3. Main Staff Decisions
Through any issues, misconduct, problems, etc. the Main Staff will converse, have meetings and discussions, with applicable members if necessary, and work to come to the best conclusion and resolution possible in a timely manner. Once any Main Staff decision has been made, it is final.

### 2. League Conduct and Issues

#### 2.1.
Code of Conduct: Every driver MUST read and understand the code of conduct. A brief list of basic rules every member must follow to ensure an enjoyable experience in the league for everyone.

#### 2.1.2. Conduct Rules
These are the basic rules of conduct the SNPM Staff and Members expect everyone to follow.

#### 2.1.2a: 
No racial or prejudice comments of any sort towards another member at any time. All privileges will be revoked.

#### 2.1.2b: 
No taunting, insulting, or abusive actions, personal or otherwise towards another member at any time.

#### 2.1.2c: 
Keep language and actions clean and professional in the race. Tempers flare and we understand competitive feelings can cloud judgment at times. But a level of maturity is expected of every driver and penalties will be issued if needed.

#### 2.1.2d: 
Be mature and respectful of everyone on and off the track. It's simple.

#### 2.1.2e: 
The SNPM Staff will step in at any time to discuss members conduct and respond to it reasonably.

#### 2.1.1. Main Staff Decision
When any individual(s) breaks the Code of Conduct rules, the Main Staff will hold a meeting with the individual(s) and come to a resolution on how to move forward and any penalties will be assessed. During this meeting, the individual(s) have their chance to discuss the issue and give their case. However, once a decision is agreed upon by the Main Staff, it is final and any penalties will be implemented immediately.

#### 2.1.2. 
Actions Detrimental To Saturday Night Pro Mazda Cup league, the Staff, and/or its members will not be tolerated. Any actions that are deemed to be with anger, malice, or spite towards any aspect, especially member of the league, will be met with punishment quickly.

#### 2.2. League Issues 
Nothing is perfect, although perfection can be strived for. SNPM continues to work with that ideology. Issues will arise and our goal is to swiftly and properly resolve them. Whether they be a disagreement between drivers where the admins must step in to keep the situation under control, or it is a mishap with race procedures or anything in between that holds the league back or keeps it from running smooth and enjoyable for everyone.

#### 2.2.1. Main Staff Decision
When any issue arises in the league, the Main Staff will discuss the problem at length and come to a resolution. Once this resolution is met, it is final and will be implemented to fix the issue.

#### 2.2.2. Reporting Issues
If you notice an issue in the league or with a driver and would like to bring it up or discuss it, you can file a protest or message an admin via Facebook, iRacing, or through our Discord server, and we will look into it. A meeting will be held with the Main Staff and yourself, as well as anyone else seeing the same issue, and a resolution will be made.


### 3. League Registration

#### 3.3. Number Selection
Your car number identifies you on a racetrack. When you register for the league on iRacing, we ask that you include your requested car number. It is best to include, in order, 2 or 3 numbers in case your first choice is already unavailable.

#### 3.3.1. Using Your Number
It is required that in every race, you register with your car number. An admin will assign your number through the league function. However, we ask that you also have your number as your "preferred number" through iRacing's customize car feature.

#### 3.3.2. Number Choice is Final

#### 3.3.3. Car Numbers
Must be a number between 00-09 and 1-99. No three-digit numbers are allowed. (new drivers that are assigned a triple-digit number/placeholder are asked to choose 1 or 2 digit number as soon as possible)

### 4. Race Procedures

#### 4.1. Race Specifics
Through seasons, SNPM has determined what we feel is one of the best ways to set up our races. With race length, weather, start times and more.

#### 4.1.1. Start Times: All times are Eastern Time zone and adjusted for daylight savings.
- Practice 7:30pm
- Qualifying 9:20pm
- Race 9:25pm

#### 4.1.2. Fixed Setup: 
We will be using setups created by iRacing. Determining that for a casual, yet competitive, league it is best for and most liked by the members to not have to worry about making setups and be able to come, race, and have fun without investing a lot of time into it.

#### 4.1.3. Race Length
We base the length of our Cup Series races on a 40-50% distance of the actual length of Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series races.

#### 4.1.4. Default Weather
SNPM has decided to utilize the "default" weather option with dynamic skies.

#### 4.2. Drivers Meeting
A brief drivers meeting will be held through the race room chat before the race at 9:00pm Eastern Time. It is required that you be present for this meeting.

#### 4.3. Practice
Practice for the race will be open from 7:30pm to 9:20pm Eastern Time. It is open to all race competitors. We ask that you keep communication in race chat to a minimum and utilize our Discord Server for general talk. As well, use caution during practice as other drivers are trying to run laps. There are no rules, per se, penalties or requirements during practice. Just be respectful of any other drivers.

#### 4.4. Qualifying
Qualifying will start at 9:20pm Eastern Time. You will have 2 laps and be given 5 minutes (10 min on road courses) to complete them.

#### 4.5. Race
Gridding will start immediately after qualifying is over. You will have 2 minutes to grid. You are not required to grid if you would prefer to start from the pits. Green flag will be approx. 9:27pm Eastern Time (9:32 on road courses).

#### 4.5.1 Race Chat
Please keep talk in the race room to a minimum and related to the race only so drivers can communicate what is going on and if there are any issues on the track.

#### 4.6. Equipment
SNPM requires that you have a working microphone and steering wheel for each race. We need to be able to communicate with you easily. We also don't allow any drivers using gamepads, keyboards, mouses, touchscreens, etc. to race with as they are very unpredictable and much harder to race with and race around someone using them.

#### 4.7. Provisionals
You are granted 5 provisionals for the Cup Series. If you can't make one of the races, you could use one of your provisionals that night. Your provisional will allow you to gain last place points rather than no-showing and getting 0 points. So for example: if there are 24 Racers at the race, you would get 25th place points rather than getting none at all. Provisionals MUST be called for BY 9:25pm ET on race night.

#### 4.8. End of Line's
No EOL's will be given at the start of any race.  If you run a qualifying time, you will start in the position you qualify in. If you choose to not run a lap in qualifying, you will already be close to the back of the field. If you still want to drop to the back, just drop to the apron and let the field go by AFTER you pass the start-finish line or you may also elect to start from the pits.

### 5. Green Flag Conditions

#### 5.1. Start/Restarts
The leader will bring the field to the green flag at pace speed and must hold a reasonable distance behind the pace car of 0.5-1.5 seconds. Once the pace car makes its turn off the track, the leader has control of the field and may accelerate at any time between then and the green light.

#### 5.1.1. Start/Restart Etiquette
Your speed at the time the leader goes must be no more than 5 mph over the leader’s speed. You are allowed to accelerate once the leader has accelerated to take the green. You may pass to the outside of the cars in front of you after the green light has come out. You are NOT allowed to pass the inside before the s/f line. These are primarily in line with iRacing's start/restart rules and any black flags given on a restart will NOT be cleared. If a large checkup or wreck happens on a restart and causes a driver to get a black flag, it may be cleared after a Main Staff decision.

#### 5.1.2. Double File
Restarts will be double file with the lapped cars in the back. The leader has lane choice and must announce their decision when we get one to go.


#### 5.2. Pitting Under Green
If you decide to pit under green flag conditions, we ask that you make any drivers around you aware that you will be pitting when you are on the backstretch prior to entering pit road.

#### 5.2.1. Exiting Pits
When exiting the pits under green flag, you must enter on the backstretch. You will have to make a pass-through penalty if you do not follow this.
***We now use iRacings pit exit/blend line (blue cone).

#### 5.3. Minimum Speed
You must maintain a reasonable speed on the racetrack to avoid being in the way or a danger to the other competitors. If we feel you are running too slow or are in the way of the other drivers, we will ask you to pull off the track and get more damage fixed.  If you have all your damage fixed, and you are still not running at a reasonable speed, we will ask you to retire from the race.  If you refuse to pull off, you will be disqualified and could be penalized for the laps you gained while you were on the track with the damaged vehicle.

#### 5.4. Substitute Drivers
Absolutely no substitute drivers allowed. If it is found out that you had someone else racing for you at any time during a league race, you will be suspended for one race and put on a probation period.

#### 5.5. Race Manipulation/Cheating
Cheating will not be tolerated. Some examples of cheating include, but are not limited to, intentionally self spinning to bring out a caution, getting up to full speed (or close to full speed) on a start/restart to attempt to blow by the field, escaping (alt-f4) to avoid wrecking or bringing out a caution or second caution etc; especially if you then attempt to re-join the race. Every situation can be different and will be reviewed.

### 6. Cautions

#### 6.1. Caution Etiquette
While pacing and on restarts, you must be in your proper position going the mandated pace speed and holding a 2 car length gap back from the car in front of you.

#### 6.1.1. Doubling Up
Once we get the one to go signal, we will go double file for the restart. At this point, you are allowed to safely pull into your assigned lane and up to the car lined up in front of you.

#### 6.1.2. Wrecking Under Caution
There should be absolutely no wrecking or messing around under caution. If you make contact with another car under caution and it's a 0x incident, you may have to serve a stop and go penalty. If you spin a car out under caution, you will serve a one-lap penalty.

#### 6.1.3. Intentional Wrecking
If you intentionally wreck another car under caution, you WILL be suspended for one race and put on probation.

#### 6.2. Lucky Dog
The lucky dog will go to the highest running car not on the lead lap. It is awarded to the driver in the highest position at least 1-lap down after a caution is waved. iRacing's system will handle who is awarded the lucky dog.

#### 6.2.1. Involved in Accident
If you are involved in the accident, you will not recieve the lucky dog and it will be awarded to the next running lapped down car. This is how iRacing's system works when awarding the free pass.

#### 6.2.2. Pass High
The lucky dog recipient must pass anyone in front of them on the high side when going around the field. The field must stay low and be aware of the lucky dog car passing.

#### 6.3. Wave Around
Any car laps down is allowed to elect to not pit under a caution period, pull up to the pace car when all lead lap cars pit, and as long as there are no lead lap cars in between them and the pace car, will be able to take the wave around at one to go.

#### 6.4. Causing Cautions
In the AMS Cup Series if you are the cause of 2 cautions in a race, you will be required to park your car for the remainder of the race. We ask that drivers take fault, if they feel it is their own fault, when an accident happens in the race. Otherwise an admin who sees the wreck will determine who was at fault. If its too close to call during the race you could still lose position after the race in the post race review of the replay or if you don't own up to a caution you may have clearly caused.

#### 6.4.1. Continuing to Cause Cautions
If you continue to cause a decent amount of cautions race after race, you will be given a warning and further action may be taken.

#### 6.5. Pitting
When coming down pit road under a caution period, all drivers must hold a reasonable line on the right side of pit road, until they are within a reasonable 1 to 5 car lengths of their pit stall.  There are dashed lines on the pit road at most tracks, we asked that you use those as a guide and stay to the right of them. Any driver who rides through the pit stalls will be given a one-lap penalty.

#### 6.5.1. Stay Single File
When coming down pit road under a caution period, stay single file and behind the car in front of you. Running 'off-centre' to the car in front of you to help avoid running into the back of them in case of a big check-up is allowed. But, once you are past the pit entrance line, marked by the yellow cones, ease back into line behind the car in front of you that you are scored behind.

#### 6.6. Don't Pass the Leader
Under caution, no driver should pass the leader for any reason. These reasons may include, to falsely get a lap led, go ahead to get on pit road, and so on.

#### 6.6.1. No Advancing Position
Under caution, there will be no advancing to the front or back of the field for any reason, which includes primarily to show displeasure to another driver, but to also gain position or time to get on pit road, cause a driver to get a black flag, etc. Stay in your position. If this happens, you will receive a one-lap penalty and probation. Second offence automatic DQ from the race and two-race suspension. A third offense will be an automatic removal from the league.

### 7. Black Flags

#### 7.1. Black Flags
All iRacing given black flags will be upheld unless a Main Staff member says otherwise. Main Staff gets the final call on all black flags given.

#### 7.1.1. Clearing Black Flags
If you feel you were wrongly given a black flag, or according to any of our rules, you should not have received one, then tell an admin your situation and we will clear it.

#### 7.1.2. Cleared Black Flags
Any black flags cleared by a Main Staff member during a race will be subject to a mandatory post-race review. If during the post-race review, there is evidence that someone lied about a black flag or Incident or mistakenly asked for it to be cleared, the blag flag will be reinstated and they will lose a lap on the official results.

#### 7.1.3. Black Flags for Avoiding a Wreck
If you're attempting to avoid a wreck, or you spin down pit road, and are NOT the cause of the accident/incident, any black flags given to you from this will be cleared. Just ask an admin to clear them.

### 10. 'Boys Have At It' Policy

We maintain a NASCAR-like 'Boys Have At It' policy here. The SNPM staff does not like to step into situations between drivers unless need be.
The Main Point: Race drivers the way you want to be raced. (NO INTENTIONALLY WRECKING YOUR FELLOW DRIVERS)
A few bullet points on this topic:
- Drivers CANNOT be wrecking, hitting, or anything of the sort under a caution period.
- The SNPM staff does follow these situations when they appear to become a constant between a set of drivers. If, at any point, we feel that the differences between the drivers is effecting the racing and other drivers, we will be forced to step in.
- At first, a meeting between the drivers involved will be held. Asking for each driver to move on. If problems persist beyond there, penalties will be levied.
- We understand that with 20 to 40 drivers in any given race, tempers are likely to flare and not everyone is going to like everyone else. That being said, we do keep track of drivers habits and if we feel something needs to be done, then we will deal with said driver.
- If a driver is a constant nuisance and is bringing out cautions on a regular basis, that will be handled accordingly.
- There is no set point in which the SNPM staff might step into a situation because we try to let it take its course and only step in once it's an issue to the overall race. However, beyond the point in which we do step in, every incident involving the same drivers will be analyzed and penalized where need be.
  (For an example of all this, see the Kyle Busch & Kevin Harvick rivalry from 2010 to 2011 and how NASCAR handled their situation.)
  ***SNPM reserves the right to reject or remove any driver that proves to be a nuisance or problem during the races at any point in time.***
  
### 11. Appeals and Issues
Any penalty can be appealed by contacting Admins here or here.

#### 11.1. Send a Message: 
Any appeal to an admin decision or a league issue should be sent to an admin via message on Facebook/iRacing or email, and in turn will be forwarded to the rest of the admins for consideration.

* All appeals should be submitted ASAP (within 7 days of violation/penalty/infraction/warning)​

#### 12. Protests - 
To submit a protest, question or concern regarding an SNPM race or driver, please do so here.

Problem drivers will be approached by admins with a warning to clean it up. If problems continue after that, suspensions may be in order.
Respect on AND off the track. (Code of Conduct)
